#The fake website


#What is this website?
This is a simple multipage website that I made with javascript, css and html. The website looks like a pretty generic website that sells some kind of a subscription online.


#Why I made this website?
This is one of my earlier projects and I made it to practice building websites using javascript, css and html and then how to make the websites reactive by using javascript and css.


#What I've learned from this project?
I mostly learned about css and how to make decent looking websites and then how to use javascript to make the UX better.
