What is this application?

This is a multi-page static website that I made with javascript, html and css to practice making reactive websites.


What can this application do?

This is just a website made for a fake company that sells some kind of subscription on their website. The website is fully reactive, has themes that you can change in settings and also there are other websites like google maps embeded in the website.


Tools I used: Javascript, HTML, CSS
